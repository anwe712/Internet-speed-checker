# Internet Speed Checker

This is a simple Python script to check your internet speed using the `speedtest-cli` library. The script measures your download and upload speeds and displays the results in Mbps (megabits per second).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `speedtest-cli` library (command: pip install speedtest-cli )

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install the `speedtest-cli` library using the following command:


## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` script.

3. Run the script using the following command:


4. The script will initiate a speed test and display your download and upload speeds.

**Note:**
- The accuracy of speed test results can vary based on factors such as server proximity and network conditions.
- Make sure your network connection is stable during the speed test for accurate results.

## Configuration (Optional)

By default, the script automatically selects the best server for the speed test. If you want to specify a specific server, you can modify the `main.py` script and provide the server ID as an argument to `st.get_best_server()`.

```python
st.get_best_server(server_list=["server_id"])


Remember to replace "main.py" with the actual filename of your script if it's named differently. Additionally, make sure to create a `LICENSE` file in the same directory with the appropriate license text if you choose to use a different license.
